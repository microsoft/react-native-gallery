If you wish to build React Native Gallery on your computer locally, follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. In the root directory of the repository on your device, run `yarn`.
3. In the same directory run `npx react-native run-windows`.

**Note: First builds will take considerably longer than subsequent builds due to the number of community modules consumed by the React Native Gallery**
